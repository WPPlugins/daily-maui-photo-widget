Adds a sidebar widget that displays a new photo from Maui everyday, with five different display styles.

== Description ==

With this plugin, you can add **a little Aloha** to your blog with the Daily Maui Photo widget. With different sizes and
display styles to choose from, it's easily to find one that fits into your blog's design.

Current features of this plugin include:

* Multiple display styles to choose from, configured on the Widgets settings page.
* Detects the current date from the user's browser settings to display correct date.
* Displays photos from the [Daily Maui Photo](http://www.dailymauiphoto.com) website.
* Purely JavaScript based, so there is no extra load on your server or database. Will not delay page load from server.
* Works in any WordPress theme that has support for Widgets.

Although full customization is not available yet, there are updates under development. If you have an idea for a
customization setting or would like to request a custom display style, please let me know.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do the different stlyes look like? =

Examples are included in the Screenshots tab on the WordPress Plugin details page. The [support page](http://www.webnelly.com/wordpress/daily-maui-photo)
also has screenshots as well as links to blogs using this plugin.

= How do I change the colors in the widget? =

Currently this is not supported by the plugin yet. If you'd like a customized style or display, please contact
me and I'll do what I can to accomodate (time permitting).

= What is part of the widget cut off? =

Each display style has a fixed width and height as specified in the Widgets settings pane. If you sidebar has
a width or a height that is smaller than the display style you chose, the 'overflow' is not displayed.

Try selecting a different display style or contact me with the dimensions that you're looking for.

= I want to change something with the display style, where are the code files? =

The code to generate the display of these widgets is actually hosted on a remote server and not saved to your
server as part of the installation. That's good because it keeps the code processing off of your server and
won't slow down your page display.

It also mean, however, that you can't edit the display yourself. One reason this is done is for design and
style compatibility, but it also done to protect the content and copyrights from being removed.

If you'd like something to be customized through the Widgets settings, contact me with a feature request and
I'll take a look.

= How can I use my own photos instead of yours? =

These photos are all taken from my [Daily Maui Photo](http://www.dailymauiphoto.com) website and are not
editable in the plugin itself. The code for managing the daily photos is part of a custom API I am developing
and may release for public use in the future (once it's finished).

In the meantime, if you're a developer looking for a head start, take a look at [this blog post](http://www.photonelly.com/blog/2008/12/flickr-idea-making-an-online-photo-calendar.html)
which describes how I'm using the Flickr API and a tagging convention to power my Daily Maui Photo offerings.

= How can I add this Widget to my theme template, a page, or a post? =

Right now, adding this Widget directly to a page or post is not supported. I have considered supporting this by 
adding a shortcode feature, so if you have a need for that, please contact me.

As for adding directly to a theme, I am working on a non-WordPress version of this widget that will
support any static html page or code file. Look for a link on the plugin [support page](http://www.webnelly.com/wordpress/daily-maui-photo)
once that's available.

= I have a feature request, how can I contact you? =

The easist way is to leave a comment on the plugin [support page](http://www.webnelly.com/wordpress/daily-maui-photo).

You can also track me down on Twitter as [@DailyMauiPhoto](http://twitter.com/DailyMauiPhoto) or on my development [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/webnellydotcom).

= I really enjoy your Maui photos, where can I see more? =

Maui is beautiful, isn't it? :)

If you'd like to see more about these daily Maui photos, head on over to <http://www.dailymauiphoto.com>. There
you'll find an RSS feed, Twitter and Facebook info, an iPhone app, and more.
